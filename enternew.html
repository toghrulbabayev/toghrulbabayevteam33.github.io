        <h1>About Website</h1>
        
        <p><br>    As group 33, we firstly finished individual part of homework 3. Afterwards, to create this website we met up with each other in campus, reserved room and studied for few hours. 
          <br>In times, we were not able to meet up we had zoom sessions. During these times we coded base of our website and then gave it a design with css. 
          <br>Main source of our knowledge about html & css came from code academy courses. For few extra features we wanted to add to our website we searched internet and used youtube tutorials.
          <br>Overall we completed the homework in 2-3 weeks. So, we divided the roles and assigned each member certain roles. Home page’ html was done by Togrul and Css’ was done by Ferhad. 
          <br>The second page html was done by Shahla and css was done by Beyim. Everyone did their own individual page(both html and css). But at the end we decided to do interior design of the pages same. 
          <br>We came to an agreement about our gorup name which "HTSS Crusaders" and logo was designed by Ferhad.<br>
